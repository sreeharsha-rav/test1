# Sreeharsha Raveendra

I'm an electronics-turned-computer engineering student with a passion for technology and problem-solving. I'm excited about the potential of 5G, AI, VR, and semiconductors in shaping our connected world, particularly in the realm of IoT. 

My programming skills are continuously improving through projects, and I believe in the importance of constant learning and growth in software development. I'm also involved in the student community, currently serving on the IEEE Student Branch executive board at ASU.

Beyond academics, I enjoy hitting the gym, hiking and reading.

Check out my portfolio - I'm actively seeking software developer roles and eager to connect with teams aiming for success.
